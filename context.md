# Greptile Software Engineer Interview Project

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. This short task is designed to test
your product intuition, ability to build standalone products, and general attention to
detail in your coding.

## Overview

Your task is to build an Al-powered changelog generator.

Examples of changelog websites:

*   [Changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog)
*   [Twilio Changelog](https://www.twilio.com/changelog)

Developers that maintain developer tools frequently have to write changelogs every
few days updating end users (also developers). The end users typically see them on
some type of public website.

The challenge with writing changelogs is twofold:

1.  You have to go through a few days of commits to make a list of everything that's
    changed
2.  You have to summarize the changes that would be relevant to an end-user in a
    few bullet points.

This is the type of job that would be perfect for an LLM!

## Submission

Your submission should have two parts:

1.  A developer-facing tool that allows devs to quickly Al-generate a changelog.
2.  A simple public-facing website where the changelog appears for people to see.

In your README, feel free to share why you made the technical and product decisions
that you made!

To submit, send us a link to the GitHub repo, including how to run the app and a
screen recording of the thing working. Just a 30-second screen recording is perfect.

## Evaluation

As a developer tools company, it's important to us that our team understands and
appreciates the art and science of building for builders. The submission will be
evaluated on the following criteria:

*   Does it work?
*   Does the backend logic make sense?
*   Is there evidence of user-centered product design choices?
*   Is it pretty (simple and minimal can be beautiful)?
*   How is the UX from the developer's perspective? How easy is it now for them to
    write a changelog?

## Rules

*   You can use any language or framework.
*   You can use any Al tools for this task, just mention the tools in the README.
*   There is no deadline, but we would appreciate you giving us a likely due date so
    we know when to follow up.
